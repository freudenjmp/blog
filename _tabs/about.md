## Name

**Freudensprung** (_leap for joy_) is German Umgangssprache (_slang_). Translate _sprung_ to _jump_ and coerce _jump_ to [x86 assembly instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JMP_(x86_instruction)) `JMP`: the perfect Wortwitz (_pun_) and unique nickname.

## Logo

The CPU acts as a trampoline to `JMP` on and should have shown _jumping bits_ `0` and `1`. Turns out I am bad with graphics, so that idea is void.
